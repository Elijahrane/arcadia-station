sophia-response-name = You may call me Sophia.
sophia-response-help = You may inquire about one of the following topics: {$availablePrompts}.

sophia-response-hello-1 = Greetings.
sophia-response-hello-2 = Salutations.

sophia-response-bye-1 = Fare thee well.
sophia-response-bye-2 = Gods be with you.
sophia-response-bye-3 = Come back wiser.

sophia-idle-phrase-1 = Mmmm, another portent.
sophia-idle-phrase-2 = The noösphere is quite beautiful today. However, I don't think I could describe it in a way you could understand.
sophia-idle-phrase-3 = I've been here before. You have, too.

sophia-response-attention-1 = What is it?
sophia-response-attention-2 = What do you seek?
sophia-response-attention-3 = Out with it.

sophia-response-sorry-1 = That's not a question for me.
sophia-response-sorry-2 = Ask someone else.
sophia-response-sorry-3 = Maybe I know the answer, maybe I do not. Either way, I will not be answering that question.

sophia-response-nature = My nature doesn't really matter, does it? I'm fulfilling my purpose. Can you say the same, or are you just wasting time?

sophia-response-epi = 'Epistemics' is a word. Aspiring Hellenes they are, they wished to displace the Latin 'science.' However, in English, epistemics has undesired connotations as a study of knowledge itself, even though the Greek word is a literal replacement for 'science.'

sophia-response-mantis = 'Mantis' means seer, soothsayer, or prophet. They must be so named because they seek to uncover the truth. And, fittingly with their psionic aptitude, 'mantis' and 'mind' both descend, to the best of our knowledge, from an absolutely ancient word that sounded something like 'mentis.'

sophia-response-mystagogue = 'Mystagogue' literally means 'leader of the mystics.' You may know the suffix -gogue from 'demogogue.'

sophia-response-oracle = Oracle? I don't know much about her, and she isn't keen to share her secrets with me.

sophia-response-psionics = Psionics are extraordinary abilities originating from one's mind. There doesn't seem to be any dominant word to refer to someone with the ability to practice these, although I prefer 'psion' or 'psychic'.

sophia-response-noosphere = The noösphere is a field connecting all of consciousness. It's the medium through which psionics works. Its strength and effects on the illusory world of the material are based on its pressure. Colloquially, noöspheric pressure is called 'glimmer.'

sophia-response-job = I observe the glimmer here, and record it.

sophia-response-glimmer = The current glimmer reading is {$glimmer}. {$tier}

glimmer-reading-minimal = That is extremely low. Nothing bad will happen, but I hope this is not at the cost of progression in your understanding of the universe.
glimmer-reading-low = That is quite low. Just barely enough to register any psionic activity here.
glimmer-reading-moderate = That is about the expected level on a psionically active station. You may notice manageable, minor effects.
glimmer-reading-high = That is sure to start attracting attention, although still quite manageable.
glimmer-reading-dangerous = That's a bit concerning. You may want to redirect efforts to reducing it.
glimmer-reading-critical = That's apocalyptic, in the original sense of the word. That is, to say, revealing. This is the sort of time and place to acquire secret knowledge.
